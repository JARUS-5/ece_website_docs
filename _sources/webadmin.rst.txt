Guide for web admins
=====================

Append admin/ to the home page url to get the Django administration site.
For example, if the website is hosted in https://eced.herokuapp.com/, 
then go to https://eced.herokuapp.com/admin/

Enter the username and password to login.

Permissions
-------------

Inorder to add/edit/delete some data in pages, an user needs permission.
Admin is a superuser, which means, they can do any of the above mentioned operations to the data.

Users can be added to a Group and giving a permission to the group will automatically give the 
permission to everyone in that group.

Accessing Permissions
------------------------

Clicking a user in the Users list will show all information stored regarding that user.
Permissions which can be provided or removed can be seen under the permission tab.

Note
-------------

I recommend reading the Django tutorial from their official website to see how admin works.
