* Profile image can be changed by clicking **Choose File** button. The highest image size limit is **5 MB** 
  but smaller image size is preferred because it reduces loading time for website visitors.
* Please refrain from leaving any of the fields empty.

Clicking **edit cards** button, will bring up a page with headings of all cards. 
You can either edit or delete a card by pressing edit or delete buttons corresponding 
to the card heading. New card can be created using the **Add card** button at the bottom
of the list. The body of a card can include tables, list, etc. 
See :ref:`Features in body<quill>` section to learn more about it.

*Note - As soon as delete button is pressed, the card will be deleted. No confirmation feature as of now!*

Features in body
------------------

Parts of website like news articles, card body, Academic pages, etc is integrated with 
an opensource WYSIWYG quill editor so that we can edit contents without writing HTML codes. 
An overview of all the functions included in the editor is given in the image below. 
Table can be inserted by clicking the **Insert table** button on the bottom-left side of the text area.

By default, 3 rows and columns are created.
A table can be further edited by right-clicking any of the table cell.

**Note - The entire body of an article is limited to a size of 5 MB.
So please note that total images+data you are including is less than 5 MB.**

Other features in website
-------------------------------

*If you ever encounter a page with permission denied message or some unexpected behaviour,
please read the paragraph below*

All faculty members has a list of permissions associated with their account. 
Permissions include adding/editing/deleting personal info, news articles, PhD page, Labs page, etc 
in the website.
Permissions are set by the website administrator or the person who has **superuser** access. 
Please contact them. 

|

News articles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

News article can be created by pressing the **Publish a News** button found in the page as soon as you login.
Every News article has a heading and a body. 
News articles are identified by their heading. 
So publishing News with unique heading is preferred. 
This can prevent unnecessary confusion on identifying the news article when editing/deleting them.

The body can include images, tables, etc as described in :ref:`Features in body<quill>` section.

|

Home page Carousel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Carousel is the slideshow of the images in home page. 
New images can be added/removed. Options for this can be found as soon as you login.

*If you are adding a new image, consider removing an old one so that 
users don't have to spend much of their internet data. 
Also, smaller image size = faster carousel load speed*

|

Other contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are other contents which faculty can edit 
(according to their permission) like Academic pages, PhD pages, etc.
But I prefer the faculty asking a student with superuser access or website admin to do this.
