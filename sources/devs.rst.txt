Guide for developers/students
==============================

There can be some mistakes in this guide as I am not an expert and 
I am writing things I learned from my point of view. 
Please let me know if you find any mistakes.

If you are entirely new to web development, check out these resources. 
I have included minimum requirements if you don't want to invest huge amount of time.

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML - For learning HTML.
    (Minimum requirement: Beginner's tutorial in this website)

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS - For learning CSS.
    (Minimum requirement: Basics on what it is)

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript - For learing JavaScript.
    (Minimum requirement: Know how to write functions)

Basics
-------------

When you type a url like http://ece.nitc.ac.in, your browser sends an UDP request to DNS Server
to resolve the domain name nitc.ac.in to an ip address. The DNS server returns the ip address and 
your browser will establish a connection to the nitc server. You will get html, css and javascript 
files through the http protocol (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) and 
your browser displays page acoording to contents in html, css and javascript files. 

A machine(host) with http server can have other http server or server with other services like sql server, etc.
Communication between clients and server happens through sockets and each socket has a port number associated with it.
For example, a machine with ip address 1.1.1.1 can have http server listening on port 80, and a sql server 
listening on port 5432.

By default, web browsers assume it is port 80 when you just type the url address.
That means, you can access http://ece.nitc.ac.in:80 and you will get the same page as before.
But changing the port number to something other than 80 in the url will result in site can't be reached error.

React
--------

React is a library used to design frontend of the website.
By running the command "npm run build", we get the html, css and javascript files which are static files.

The frontend files are available at https://github.com/JARUS-5/ecewebsite. 
Check the README.md file from the above link to know more about setting up the project.

There are many tutorials out there to get you into react and you need to know the basics.

Django
--------

Django is a backend framework. We use django to serve the static files we got from React build and 
to communicate with the database.

The backend files are available at https://github.com/JARUS-5/ecewebsitebackend.
Check the README.md file from the above link to know more about setting up the project.

The tutorial in their official website is the best way to get started in django.

Website architecture
-------------------------------

The html, css and js files used for displaying webpages (frontend) are created using React 
and its libraries like material-ui.
When a client requests for the webpage, django gives these html, css and js files.
The js files in the client-side requests django for data to be displayed (like faculty details), 
django then requests corresponding data from PostgreSQL server and return it to the client.
