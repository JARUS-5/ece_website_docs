First time use instruction for faculty
---------------------------------------
I recommend changing password as soon as you log in for the first time (:ref:`link to guide <changingpsswd>`).
Passwords in Django are encrypted and therefore cannot be retrieved if its lost. 
The web administrator cannot see the password but has the permission to change it (if password is lost).
